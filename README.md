# Express Tutorial

This is the source code for a tutorial on my [personal site](https://www.kyrelldixon.com) that walks you step-by-step to build out a REST api from scratch.

The actual post can be found [here](https://www.kyrelldixon.com).

## Requirements

To get the code running, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. A link to get both setup can be found [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

## Getting Started

To get things up and running:

1. Install packages

```bash
npm install # or yarn
```

2. Run the server

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

If you have any issues, updates, or requests, feel free to go to the issues tab and add an issue!
